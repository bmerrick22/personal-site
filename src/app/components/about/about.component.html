            <h3>Developer, frontend engineer, designer, student</h3>
            <h6>Hey there, my name is Ben and I am a senior at the University at Notre Dame. I will be graduating in the Spring
                of 2021 with a degree in Computer Science. I am involved in numerous clubs, student leadership, and other on campus
                experiences such as club lacrosse. I am from the northern suburbs of Chicago and will be moving to San Francisco next 
                year to begin my work as an Associate Software Engineer at Veeva Systems. I love to hang out with friends, play sports,
                and code. Enjoy my website!
